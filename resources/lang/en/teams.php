I created Kanka in October 2017 because there was no tool that easily allowed me to create a world with my friends and still allow me to control who could see or do what.

In early 2020 I took a leap of faith to work full time on Kanka thanks to the support of friends and the community.

Jay and I have been friends for almost a decade, and it has been exciting to see him develop Kanka over the past couple years.

In early 2020, I joined Jay to handle both business development & marketing, and I havenâ€™t looked back since!

I started using Kanka in early 2018 and was one of the first people to join the Discord. I promptly started making work for Jay by creating a whole list of possible features for the (then upcoming) calendars.

Nowdays I help out with the community on Discord and Reddit, and break new versions so you don't have to.
