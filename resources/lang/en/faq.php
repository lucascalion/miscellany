The best way we can explain Attribute Templates is with an example. Let's imagine that your world has lots of Locations, and on many of those locations, you want to remember to create a custom Attribute for "Population", "Climate", "Crime Level".

Now, you could easily do that on every Location, but it can get tedious, and you might forget sometimes to create the attribute "Crime Level". This is where Attribute Templates come into play.

You can create an Attribute Template with those attributes (Population, Climate, Crime Level, etc), and later apply that template to your locations. This will create the attributes from the template on the locations, so all you have to do is change the values and not have to remember about the attributes!

Yes! We strongly believe that your financial situation shouldn't impact your enjoyment of RPGs or world building and we will always keep the core app free. However, if you wish to take a more active role in this journey, support us, and vote on the features that matter the most to you, you can do so through our subscriptions.

In addition to voting on the direction that Kanka takes, supporting us allows you to gain access to :boosters, increase file size upload limits, add your name to the hall of fame, have nicer default icons, and more!

The long-term plan for Kanka is to build a versatile worldbuilding and campaign management tool that is system agnostic with content managed by the community in the form of "Community Templates". Another goal of ours is to build tools that integrate with other platforms like Virtual Tabletop apps.

We use Kanka ourselves, so we have no plans to ever stop developing and improving it. However, just to be safe, the project is also open source and can be picked up by the community if something were to ever happen to us.
